# Brain Tumor Image Segmentation
Iâ€™ve built and trained a U-Net model to perform image segmentation on brain MRI scans, able to detect different types of brain tumors.
Using a dataset from the Medical Decathlon Challenge, I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture, commonly used for segmentation tasks.
